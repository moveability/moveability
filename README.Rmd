# moveability: walkability and cycleability metrics for global cities

## Warning: Currently experimental only

Open-source engine to calculate comprehensive moveability statistics for
a global cities. Moveability is intended to connote any means by which people
might actively move thenselves, primarily implying walking and cycling, but
also potentially skating, scootering, wheelchairing, or any other conceivable
form of active transport.

## Usage

Currently only one function that works like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library (moveability)
verts <- moveability (city = "muenster germany")
```
The function does a heap of heavy work, downloading the entire street network
and calculating routes between every single pair of points in the network. This
is likely to take quite some time - at least several minutes - but will provide
progress information on the way. The result is a `data.frame` of all points in
the street network for the nominated city, with a column `$m` quantifying
moveability.

The result can be directly viewed with
[`mapdeck`](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck) with the following code:

```{r mapdeck, eval = FALSE}
library (mapdeck)
set_token (Sys.getenv ("MAPBOX_TOKEN"))
loc <- c (mean (verts$x), mean (verts$y))
verts$m <- 20 * verts$m / max (verts$m)
mapdeck (style = 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9',
         zoom = 12,
         location = loc) %>%
    add_pointcloud (data = verts,
              layer_id = "walkability",
              lon = "x",
              lat = "y",
              radius = 10,
              fill_colour = "m",
              palette = "inferno")
```

or the same thing plotted as polygons of city blocks

and finally projected back on to the street network, repeating full code to
demonstrate how
```{r ms, eval = FALSE}
streetnet <- dodgr::dodgr_streetnet (bbox = "mÃ¼nster de", expand = 0.05) %>%
    dodgr::weight_streetnet (wt_profile = "foot") # or whatever
m <- moveability (streetnet = streetnet)
lsf <- moveability_to_lines (m, streetnet) # sf-format linestrings
# add "width" for plotting:
lsf$width <- sqrt (lsf$flow * 10 / max (lsf$flow))

library (mapdeck)
set_token (Sys.getenv ("MAPBOX_TOKEN"))
loc <- colMeans (do.call (rbind, l$geometry))
mapdeck (style = 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9',
         zoom = 12,
         location = loc) %>%
    add_path (data = lsf,
              stroke_colour = "flow",
              stroke_width = "width",
              palette = "inferno")
```
